# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to think, learn, reason, and make decisions. It includes subfields like:

1. Machine Learning (ML) – Systems learn from data.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Understanding and generating human language (like ChatGPT).
3. Computer Vision – Analyzing visual data (images/videos).
4. Expert Systems – Rule-based systems for decision making.
